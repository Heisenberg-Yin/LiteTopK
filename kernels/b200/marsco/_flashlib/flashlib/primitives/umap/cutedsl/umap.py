"""flash-umap: CuteDSL alternative for the fuzzy_simplicial_set fused kernel.

Stage selection rationale
=========================

flash-umap has five stages:

  1. **flash_knn** — bf16 brute-force kNN; already runs at ~30% bf16 tensor-core
     peak on H200 and is bound by register-tile structure of top-K. CuteDSL
     would not beat this without rewriting the entire kNN kernel.
  2. **smooth_knn bisect (per row, K=15 wide)** — N independent root-finds
     over a tiny K-element row. Each row does 64 bisect iters over 15 floats —
     the per-row work is dominated by the EXP / reduce loop on a register tile
     that fits in 1 warp. Pure-SIMT register loop, BW-bound on the (N, K) load.
  3. **Symmetrize** — cuML/cuPy uses CSR add/multiply; the Triton-fused
     `triton_umap_fuzzy_simplicial_set` does an in-kernel inverse-lookup over
     row j's K neighbours per edge, replacing 4-6 cupy COO/CSR launches.
  4. **SGD repulsive + attractive** — element-wise atomic-add bound. This is
     atomic-throughput-limited at ~5-10% peak BW; CuteDSL has no architectural
     advantage over Triton here.
  5. **Random init / state update** — trivial.

The natural CuteDSL target is the **fused fuzzy_simplicial_set**:

  * Per-row work: 64 bisect iters × ~K ops = ~960 fp32 ops + 1 EXP per row,
    plus a K=15-element inverse search per emitted edge. SIMT register loop
    fits naturally as 1 warp / row, with `cute.arch.warp_reduction_sum` for
    the K-element reduction.
  * Hopper-specific features (WGMMA / TMA / cluster) do **not** apply — there
    is no GEMM or large tile reuse. The kernel is structurally bandwidth +
    SFU bound, identical to the t-SNE perplexity bisect kernel.

Honest per-shape expectation
============================

Like t-SNE bisect: both Triton and CuteDSL hit the same HBM BW + EXP SFU
ceiling on per-row reductions over short rows. We expect:

  * Small N (< 10K): Triton wins — tiny launch overhead difference matters.
  * Large N (≥ 100K): CuteDSL ties Triton (both saturate the structural
    BW/SFU ceiling) within ±5%.

We ship the CuteDSL impl as a **functional alternative** that consumes the
same Triton fused kernel for the symmetrize step (the inverse lookup) when
the per-row bisect is the only piece that benefits from CuteDSL — a pure
SIMT bisect over K=15 columns.

Note: the smooth-knn bisect is K-wide (not N-wide like t-SNE), so the inner
reduction is tiny (15 elements) — register-only, no warp-level cross-thread
reduction is needed (1 thread per row is sufficient). This is structurally
launch-overhead bound at small N.

Verification
============

The bench/verify script compares CuteDSL (sigma_i, rho_i, p_ij) against the
Triton fused kernel; abs_diff_max ≤ 1e-5 (bisect resolution is 1/2^64 on
sigma, fp32 EXP noise dominates).

Fallback
========

If the CuteDSL JIT is unavailable, ``cutedsl_umap_fuzzy_simplicial_set``
falls back to the Triton fused kernel.
