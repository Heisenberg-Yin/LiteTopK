"""flash_knn -- host-side dispatcher: kernel/config selection + 2-stage launch.

Backs the public :func:`flashlib.primitives.knn.flash_knn` entry point.

Top-level wrappers
------------------

* :func:`flash_knn_triton` -- one-shot kNN, returns ``(B, N, k)`` int32
  indices. The shape-only heuristic now handles both build (large-N,
  single-pass per CTA) and search (small-N, M-split flash-decode)
  without any host-side SM-saturation gate -- ``ctas_no_split`` is
  inspected after BN is picked, so build shapes (``BN=128`` ->
  ``ctas_no_split`` already saturates 132 SMs) and search shapes
  (small BN -> M-split for tail-fill) both fall out of the same
  decision tree.
* :func:`flash_knn_triton_small_n` / :func:`flash_knn_triton_large_n`
  -- explicit overrides for callers (e.g. K-means assign) that know
  their shape category at construction time.
* :func:`_heuristic_config`, :func:`_autotune` -- shape-only heuristic
  (default, fast first call) + opt-in brute-force autotune (slower
  first call, cached steady-state). Both share the same kernel grid;
  ``force_path="large_n"`` collapses M-splits down to one per CTA.

Two kernels live behind this dispatcher:

* :mod:`insert`    -- iterative argmin-insert top-K. Picked by the
  heuristic on virtually every shape.
* :mod:`sortmerge` -- packed-uint64 sort-merge top-K with the IEEE-
  sortable u32 transform. Routed to for the **Pattern-A small-Q**
  corner (``B*N <= 8 or (B*N <= 16 and K in {32, 64})``) at medium-K
  + ``M <= 200K`` where the wider sort per chunk beats insert's
  argmin loop on this regime's autotune data. Otherwise insert wins;
  sortmerge is kept in :func:`_gen_configs` so the offline tuner can
  keep verifying that.

Pipelining depth
----------------
Both kernels take a ``NUM_STAGES_PIPE`` constexpr for the M-loop's
``tl.range`` pipelining factor. The dispatcher tunes it per shape from
a 201-shape ns-sweep (upstream ``bench/sweep_ns_by_k.py``): K<=8 +
small tile wants ``ns=3`` to hide HBM latency, K>=64 + big tile wants
``ns=2`` (registers tight), wide-D wants ``ns=2`` uniformly, narrow
tile + anything wants ``ns=1`` to avoid spills. See the comments
inside :func:`_heuristic_config` for the empirical breakdown.

Distance recovery
-----------------
The kernels emit **signed shifted scores** ``s = c_sq - 2*<x, c>``, not
true squared L2. ``argmin-k`` over ``s`` matches ``argmin-k`` over true
squared L2 (since ``-||x||^2`` is a per-row constant), but the returned
score is not a valid distance. The :func:`flash_knn` public wrapper
calls :func:`flashlib.kernels.distance.triton_knn_gather_sqdist` on the
returned indices to write the true ``||x - c[idx]||^2`` per neighbour.

    register-resident at the tile sizes used by the dispatcher's

    is sometimes elided by Triton's pipeliner. Including any of these

        NB >= 8K  -> BN=128 (64 for D>=256 + K>=32).

        The M-bump rule fixes the ``(1, 128, 10M, 64, 10)`` regression
        identified by flashlib -- at M=10M each extra N-tile costs
        ~300us of c-replication HBM traffic.

      * **BM by K**:
        K<=4         -> 128/256 (256 only at very-small M + small NB);
        K=5..16      -> 128 default (256 at huge-M);
        K=32         -> 128 default (256 at NB<=8 + M<=200K);
        K>=64        -> 64 default (sortmerge at NB<=8).

      * **kernel_mode**:
        ``sortmerge`` only when ``NB <= 8`` and ``K ∈ {32, 64, 128}``
        and ``D <= 256`` and ``M <= 200K`` (Pattern-A1), plus a
        secondary ``NB <= 16 + K ∈ {32, 64} + M <= 200K`` corner
        (Pattern-A2). All other shapes use ``insert``.

      * **num_warps**: 4 everywhere except tiny tiles (BN=8 + BM<=64 +
        K<=4 + huge M, where nw=2 wins by reducing register pressure)
        and the BN=16 + huge-M + small-K corner where nw=2 frees a
        warp set for the topK epilogue.

      * **target waves**: 1 for build (NB>=8K) and very-large K;
        2 for medium/large M; 4 for small M + small K.

      * **NUM_STAGES_PIPE**: 2 by default; 3 for BN>=64 + BM<=128 +
        K<=8 (small tile + tiny K hides HBM latency) and for
        BN ∈ [16, 32] + BM=256 + K>=64 (big tile keeps K loop fed);
        1 for narrow-tile + any K (avoid register spills) and for the
        D-split path; 2 for D_INNER>=256 and for BN>=128. Without
        this rule, K>=64 + D=256 shapes hit catastrophic regressions
        (e.g. ``(1,16,100K,256,128)`` 439us -> 2429us at ns=1, a 5.5x
        slowdown); conversely K<=32 + huge-M shapes save 20-45% vs

    handles both build and eval shapes without a host-side forced path.

    Neither path materialises an N×M cross or distance matrix to HBM,
    and neither computes or loads ``x_sq`` -- the two hard contracts
    flashlib's KNN imposes on every Triton entry point here.

        c: ``(B, M, D)`` corpus, same dtype.
        k: number of neighbours.
        autotune: ``False`` (default) uses the shape-only heuristic --
            first call pays a single Triton compile (~0.5 s). ``True``
            runs the full brute-force sweep + caches per shape (~30-90 s
            first call).
