"""Hopper SM90 fused flash-knn CuteDSL kernel (x²-free, index-only).

Sibling of the Triton kernels in :mod:`flashlib.primitives.knn.triton`:
same shift-invariant scoring ``s = c_sq[m] − 2·cross`` so ``argmin-K``
matches true ``argmin ||x − c||²`` without ever loading ``x_sq``.

Contract:

* No ``mXsq_n`` in the kernel signature (no HBM load).
* No per-thread ``xs`` register cache.
* No ``d >= 0`` clamp (score can be negative).
* No ``mOutV_nk`` (vals output) -- only the ``mOutI_nk`` (idx) tensor
  is written. Saves ``B·N·K·4`` HBM bytes and a register-file pass per
  CTA. True distances are recovered by
  :func:`flashlib.kernels.distance.triton_knn_gather_sqdist` outside
  the fused pass.

The ``sortmerge_packed`` top-K strategy is not supported here -- it
relies on ``Int64`` ordering matching ``fp32`` ordering in the upper
32 bits, which only holds for non-negative scores. The autotune
wrapper in :mod:`flashlib.primitives.knn.cutedsl.impl` filters it out
and selects between ``insert / perthread / sortmerge / smem_perthread
/ warpsort`` (all of which use native fp32 compares that work for
signed scores).

This module implements ``HopperFlashKnnFused``: a TMA + WGMMA fused
kernel that computes top-K nearest neighbors per query without ever
materialising the ``(N, M)`` cross or distance matrix in HBM. The
streaming axis is the database index ``M``: each CTA tile keeps its
``BN_query x BM_db`` cross accumulator in WGMMA registers, fuses the
``c_sq - 2*cross`` signed-score computation in registers, and
maintains a per-thread per-row top-K register heap that is updated
across database tiles. After the M-stream loop, the per-thread heaps
are merged across the WGMMA TV-layout's threads-in-row group via
butterfly shuffle, then sorted, and written to GMEM.

The architecture mirrors ``flash_kmeans/_cutedsl_assign_kernel.py``
(the kmeans assignment kernel, which is essentially KNN with K=1)
with two extensions:

  1. Per-row top-K register heap (instead of a single best_d/best_i
     scalar pair): each thread holds K_PAD fp32 + K_PAD int32 entries
     per query row it owns. K_PAD must be a constexpr power-of-two
     (16 or 32). Insertion is the standard "find argmax -> conditional
     replace" pattern, with a ``heap_max`` threshold cached for
     branch-pruning candidate distances early.

  2. Cross-thread top-K butterfly merge (instead of a single argmin
     warp-reduce): for each round of the WGMMA TV-layout's N-side
     reduction group, every thread exchanges its K_PAD entries with
     its peer at offset 2^r, then tries to insert all K_PAD peer
     entries into its own heap. After ``log2(group_size)`` rounds,
     every thread in the group has the same global top-K_PAD heap
     for its row. The row leader writes to GMEM.

K_PAD regimes
=============

K_PAD <= 32: the full top-K state fits in registers per thread. This
file implements that path. Above 32, the per-thread register pressure
exceeds Hopper's max-regs (240/thread) once you add the WGMMA acc and
the 2x heap entries per row, so a SMEM-resident sorting variant would
be needed; that path is not implemented here.

WS variant
==========

Like the kmeans kernel, ``use_ws=True`` enables FMHA-style producer/
consumer warp specialization: 1 producer WG (24 regs/thread, only
issues TMA loads) plus the existing MMA WGs (240 regs/thread, do
WGMMA + per-row top-K). Selected per-shape by autotune.

Top-K strategies (selectable, no compile heuristic)
===================================================

The ``topk_strategy`` ctor argument explicitly picks the inner
top-K kernel. ``"auto"`` falls back to a coarse K_PAD-keyed default
for callers that don't drive the autotuner. The autotuner in
``flashlib.primitives.knn.cutedsl.impl.cutedsl_flash_knn`` sweeps
strategies × tiles × use_ws and picks the empirical winner per shape.

Strategy summary:

  ``insert``         : cooperative chunk-best argmin, replicated heap.
                       Only competitive for K_PAD <= 2.
  ``perthread``      : per-thread sorted-asc top-K + branch-free
                       bubble insert. Wins K_PAD = 4..14.
  ``sortmerge``      : per-thread bitonic chunk-sort + sorted merge.
                       Wins K_PAD >= 16.
  ``sortmerge_packed`` : same network as ``sortmerge`` but packs
                       (fp32 distance, int32 idx) into a single Int64
                       (Triton's stage-1 trick). Halves the per-swap
                       op count on paper, but on Hopper SP (no native
                       64-bit integer ALU throughput) the resulting
                       PTX is consistently 20-40% SLOWER than the
                       unpacked path -- kept as an opt-in escape
                       hatch and as documentation of "tried this,
                       lost on Hopper". Excluded from the default
                       autotune sweep.
  ``smem_perthread`` : 1-thread-per-row top-K reading dist staged
                       through SMEM. Foundation for the (still-
                       planned) WS3 path. Two perf-critical fixes
                       applied vs the naive impl:
                       (a) sDist row stride padded to BN+1 to break
                       the 32-way bank conflict that would otherwise
                       arise on the consumer reads (each topk
                       thread reads sDist[my_row, j] sequentially;
                       with stride=BN=128 fp32 == 0 mod 32 banks,
                       all 32 lanes hit the same bank); padding to
                       BN+1 makes stride%32 == 1 so every lane
                       lands on a distinct bank. ~2.3x at K=8.
                       (b) Inner ``for j in range(BN)`` switched
                       from ``range_constexpr`` (full unroll) to
                       ``range(BN, unroll=4)`` because the fully
                       unrolled BN=128 * (load + setp + K-deep
                       bubble) blows past the 240-reg cap and
                       spills heavily; partial unroll caps the
                       inlined chunk size. ~3x at K=12-32.
                       Even after both fixes, standalone is still
                       1.4-2x slower than ``sortmerge`` -- only
                       useful as the WS3 inner kernel where it can
                       overlap with GEMM in a separate warpgroup.
                       Excluded from autotune sweep until WS3 ships.
  ``warpsort``       : Lane-cooperative bitonic, mirrors Triton's
                       ``tl.sort``. dist tile staged through ``sDist``
                       (same BN+1-pad layout as smem_perthread); per
                       chunk each warp loads ROWS_PER_WARP rows in
                       parallel (1 element per lane per row), runs a
                       multi-row warp-cooperative bitonic sort across
                       the 32 lanes via ``shuffle_sync_bfly``, then
                       merges with the running per-warp top-K via
                       reverse-shfl + elementwise-min + bitonic-finish.
                       Per-substage all 2*ROWS shfls are issued first
                       (into ``peer_*_buf``) before any compare/select,
                       so the bfly issue stream stays full through the
                       24-cycle Hopper shfl latency.

                       Empirical: 21 ms at K=4..32 on the standard
                       N=16384/M=100K/D=128/BM=BN=128 shape -- 4-5x
                       SLOWER than ``sortmerge``. Per-CTA-per-chunk
                       SHFL.BFLY count is 2688 (verified via SASS),
                       and at the SM-scheduler issue rate of 1
                       inst/sub-partition/cycle with 8 warps spread
                       across 4 sub-partitions (= 2 warps competing
                       per partition), the kernel is shfl-throughput
                       bound at ~10 cycles/shfl in the steady state.
                       Total: 781 chunks * 2688 shfls * 10 cycles /
                       1.83 GHz ~= 11 ms per CTA per warp; 1 wave on
                       H100 (128 CTAs / 132 SMs) lands at ~21 ms.

                       Why ``sortmerge`` (per-thread bitonic) wins
                       here despite having more raw ops: the per-
                       thread sort is intra-thread (NO shfls in the
                       inner loop, only at the cross-thread merge
                       at the very end), so it doesn't compete for
                       the warp scheduler's shfl issue slots. Triton
                       gets away with ``tl.sort`` because its
                       generated sort has fewer total shfls (smaller
                       chunk size = BM=32 vs our BM=128 -- but BM>=64
                       is forced by WGMMA atom shape so we can't drop
                       to Triton's 32) and runs in a higher-occupancy
                       layout that hides shfl latency across many
                       waves of CTAs.

                       Kept as an opt-in strategy for documentation
                       and as a reference implementation of the
                       lane-cooperative bitonic primitive. Excluded
                       from the default autotune sweep -- it never
                       wins the competitive set on Hopper at BN>=64.

Tie-break in the sort comparators
=================================

All compare-swap helpers (``_cmp_swap_asc/_desc``,
``_cmp_swap_2d_asc``, ``_bubble_insert_asc``) and the post-sort
min-pair use a STRICT ``>`` on distance, with NO secondary
``(da == db) and (ia > ib)`` tie-break. The tie-break costs one
extra SETP, AND, and OR per swap (~3 ops out of ~9) and gives a
measurable ~1.4x speedup at K_PAD=32 on Hopper to drop. The trade-
off is that two equal-distance entries within a per-thread or
per-warp top-K may end up in either order; the final TOP-K SET is
unaffected (verified: idx_match=1.0 at K=1..32 on N=4096 M=16384
D=128). Bit-exact parity with Triton's packed-uint64 sort across
ties is therefore not guaranteed (and would only matter on
synthetic data with many ties anyway).

Empirical perf vs Triton (N=16384, M=100k, D=128, H100 SXM)
==========================================================

After the tie-break drop + sortmerge / perthread strategy mix +
small-tile (BM=64 BN=64) wins for low K + the smem_perthread bank-
conflict fix:

  32    7210 us    4895 us   1.47x   BM=128 BN=128 sortmerge  lose

Tile-size insight: BM=64 BN=64 sweeps to the front for K<=20 because
N_per_thr drops from 32 (BM=128 BN=128) to 16, so per-thread chunk
work scales as 16*log^2(16)/32*log^2(32) = ~1/3, even though we pay
for 2x more CTAs (and thus 2 waves on H100's 132 SMs). For K=24..32
the K_INTERNAL=32 heap dominates per-row work and the larger tile
amortises GEMM+TMA setup better.

The K>=14 gap is fundamental: Triton's ``tl.sort`` parallelises the
bitonic substages across SIMT lanes via warp shuffles (each compare-
swap is ~3 cycles regardless of how many elements the row holds),
while our per-thread bitonic pays O(N log^2 N) sequential cycles on
each thread for its N_per_thr-element slice. The ``warpsort``
strategy (see Strategy summary above) implements (a) a lane-
cooperative bitonic via ``shuffle_sync_bfly`` mirroring Triton's
``tl.sort``, but on Hopper SM90 with CuTeDSL it runs ~4-5x SLOWER
than ``sortmerge``: with WGMMA forcing BM>=64 the per-chunk shfl
count (2688 SHFL.BFLY per CTA per chunk) exceeds the warp-scheduler
issue rate that 8 warps / 4 sub-partitions can sustain, and
``sortmerge``'s per-thread bitonic (which uses ZERO shfls in its
inner loop) wins on the same SM scheduler budget. Closing this on
Hopper would need either (b) a small-chunk re-architecture (chunk
size = K_PAD, like Triton) which is incompatible with WGMMA's
64-row M-atom minimum, or (c) a lower-level ldmatrix.sync layout
that gets the data 1-element-per-lane in registers without the
SMEM round-trip + scheduler contention. Tracked as future work.

Inline-PTX experiment (2026-05-08) -- bottom line: marginal
============================================================

Hypothesis: ptxas refuses to fold ``(da > db) ? db : da`` into
``min.f32`` (NaN semantics differ), so the bitonic SASS is all
``FSEL/SEL`` (1182+1065 ops) with zero ``FMNMX``. Hand-rolling the
cmp_swap as ``llvm.inline_asm`` with explicit ``min.f32 + max.f32 +
setp + 2x selp.b32`` should let ptxas use FMNMX (1184 ops in the
re-dumped SASS, verified) and free up issue slots for the i-side
selps.

Measured (sortmerge BM=128 BN=128 N=16384 M=100K D=128, K=16):

  cmp_swap form                 K_PAD=16  K_PAD=24  spill bytes (K=24)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  MLIR baseline (5 ops)         5006 us   7194 us   144
  inline-PTX setp+selp (5 ops)  5016 us   7135 us   144  (no win)
  inline-PTX min/max  (5 ops)   4848 us   7848 us   152  (3% / -9%)
  inline-PTX min/max gated      4866 us   7198 us   144

Conclusions:
  * Inline PTX with ``setp+selp`` packed -- 0% gain (ptxas already
    cross-schedules MLIR-lowered ops in a single basic block).
  * Inline PTX with ``min.f32 + max.f32`` -- +3% at K_PAD<=16 because
    FMNMX has marginally lower latency than ``setp+selp`` and frees
    the i-side select pipeline. At K_PAD>=24 the K_INTERNAL=32 heap
    is already register-pressure bound (~144 bytes of pre-existing
    spill at baseline); the struct-return of inline_asm adds 8 more
    bytes of spill and the gain inverts to a 9% regression.
  * Net production impact = 0: the autotuner picks ``perthread`` (not
    ``sortmerge``) at K_PAD<=12 (where inline-PTX would otherwise
    win) and ``sortmerge`` at K_PAD>=20 (where inline-PTX would
    regress); the small K_PAD=14..16 gap where ``sortmerge`` is
    chosen is too narrow for 3% to flip the verdict vs Triton.
  * Code reverted to the MLIR baseline. ``_cmp_swap_asc_ptx`` and
    ``_cmp_swap_asc_packed_ptx`` (q.v.) retained as documentation of
    the inline-PTX wiring, and the packed variant IS used by
    ``_cmp_swap_asc_packed`` since it cuts ``sortmerge_packed``'s
    spill in half (104->64 bytes) and gives a real 30-50% speedup on
    that path -- but ``sortmerge_packed`` itself is still 20% slower
    than the unpacked ``sortmerge`` on Hopper because per-cmp_swap
    op count is 6 (2 ISETP + 4 SEL.b32 from the u64 lowering) vs 5
    for the (fp32, int32) pair, and Hopper has no native 64-bit ALU
    to amortise the +1 op.

The K_PAD=14..32 wall therefore stands. Closing it requires the
small-chunk lane-cooperative architecture (Triton's tl.sort path)
which WGMMA's 64-row M-atom minimum on Hopper precludes.

WS3 design (LANDED 2026-05-08, chunk-min added 2026-05-08 PM)
=============================================================

3 warpgroups (1 load + 1 GEMM + 1 top-K) with a ``dist_pipeline``
ring buffer between GEMM and top-K, so per-chunk wall becomes
``max(t_gemm, t_topk)`` rather than ``t_gemm + t_topk``. Enabled
via ``HopperFlashKnnFused(use_ws=True, use_ws3=True,
topk_strategy='smem_perthread', dist_stage=2)``; the autotuner
adds it as a candidate for K_PAD>=14.

KEY OPTIMISATION (2026-05-08 PM): per-row chunk-min early exit.
Mirrors Triton stage-1's ``if chunk_best < topk_worst_val: ...``
(knn_triton.py:692). The GEMM WG inline-reduces the BN dist
columns to a per-row min while writing sDist (one extra fp32
store per row per chunk into sChunkMin[BM, dist_stage]); the
TopK WG checks ``chunk_min < worst_d`` once per chunk and
skips the entire BN-element prune-and-bubble loop when no
element of the chunk can possibly improve. Cost per pruned
chunk per row drops from ``BN ld + BN setp + (rare) K-deep
bubble inserts`` (~192 ops) down to ``1 ld + 1 setp + 1 BRA``
(~3 ops) -- a 64x reduction. At steady state with random
data >99% of chunks past the first ~K are pruned, so this
cuts the K=20..32 WS3 wall by 12-30% (e.g. K=24 6024 -> 5372
us, K=20 5877 -> 5104 us, K=4 5653 -> 3670 us).

Why it works (the earlier "shelved" analysis was wrong on tile
choice, not on architecture): the prior estimate had t_topk =
7.3ms for ``smem_perthread`` at BM=64 BN=64. That's correct for
that tile -- but at BM=128 BN=64 the per-CTA work doubles, the
CTA count halves, the pipeline overhead amortises, and the wall
collapses to ~6.0ms at K=24 vs the WS2 best of 7.2ms (1.20x
speedup). At BM=64 BN=64 WS3 still loses (~10.8ms vs ~7.2ms);
this is why the autotuner only enables WS3 with BM=128 BN=64.

Constraints (enforced in ``__init__``):
  * ``mma_warp_groups == 1`` so total CTA = 3*128 = 384 threads
    fits the 64K register file. Practically: BM=64, or BM=128
    with BN<=64 (BM=128 BN>=128 has atom_layout=(2,1,1) -> 2 mma
    WGs -> 4 WGs total which doesn't fit).
  * ``topk_strategy == 'smem_perthread'`` -- the only inner top-K
    that doesn't depend on the WGMMA output TV layout for its
    inputs. The dist tile is staged through SMEM in row-major,
    1-thread-per-row, so the top-K WG never touches WGMMA-shaped
    fragments.

dist_stage tuning (REVISED 2026-05-08 EVE after ncu profiling):
  * ``dist_stage=1`` blocks GEMM on every chunk waiting for topK
    drain -- 1.5x worse than dist_stage>=2.
  * ``dist_stage=2`` was the prior default.
  * ``dist_stage=3`` is the NEW default for K_PAD>=14, reliably
    4-11% faster than stage=2 across K=4..32. Why: ncu showed the
    GEMM WG was stalled 49% on shared-store scoreboard (waiting
    for the 2-stage ring to drain); a third buffer keeps GEMM
    running while TopK consumes the other two, restoring overlap.
  * ``dist_stage=4`` fails (CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE -- 228 KB
    SMEM budget exceeded at BM=128 BN=64).

The dominant inefficiency is the WGMMA m64n64 fp32 acc TV layout
(8 rows x 4 col-pairs per warp) hammering the same 14 banks
during ``_stage_dist_to_smem`` (stride-2 col pattern within
each 4-thread row group). Triton's ``tl.dot`` keeps acc in
registers and never has to relay through SMEM, so it dodges
this entirely.

Tried-and-failed: K_SW128 swizzle on sDist. Reduced shared-store
conflicts from 73.86% to 48.7% but added 37% more instructions
(per-access XOR), making the kernel 19% SLOWER (7.07 -> 8.46 ms).
The standard CUTLASS atom swizzles are tuned for A/B WGMMA OPERAND
loads, not accumulator stores with the stride-2 col pattern --
they only break the in-atom conflicts, not the cross-atom-along-N
patterns that dominate at BN=64.

** MODE H: cross-WG worst_d feedback (2026-05-08 EVE -- BIG WIN) **

The breakthrough was realising that we don't need to FIX the
bank conflicts -- we can just SKIP the SMEM writes entirely for
the 99% of chunks that the consumer would prune anyway. The
mechanism (``Mode H'' in the dispatch table):

  1. Allocate ``sWorstD[BM]`` fp32 in SMEM, init to +inf.
  2. After each chunk the TopK WG processes, write
     ``sWorstD[my_row] = topk_d[K-1]`` (the heap's K-th-worst,
     which is exactly the threshold a new candidate must beat).
  3. The GEMM WG, after WGMMA but BEFORE staging dist to sDist,
     does a 2-pass write:
       Pass 1: compute per-thread per-row min of d (no STS).
               cross-shfl-reduce over 4-threads-in-row.
       Pass 2: read sWorstD[m_local]; if row_min >= worst_d_stale,
               SKIP the row's 16 STS + d-compute. Else write all
               16 d values to sDist (existing path).
     chunk_min is ALWAYS written to sChunkMin (the consumer's
     existing prune gate handles correctness on skipped rows).

Stale-read safety: heap top is monotonically NON-INCREASING
(each insert reduces or keeps), so any sWorstD value GEMM reads
is a CONSERVATIVE upper bound on the current worst_d. GEMM may
process chunks that could have been pruned (correct, just
slightly slower) but never SKIPS a chunk that the consumer
would have processed. Single fp32 LDS/STS are atomic on aligned
addresses -- no torn reads.

** TILE-SIZE SWEEP (2026-05-09) -- SMALLER tiles often WIN BIG **

After Mode H closed the SMEM-relay bottleneck, the next
critical insight was that the "default" BM=128 BN=64 was
NOT optimal across shapes. SWEEP across (BM, BN) in
{64, 128} x {64, 128, 256} revealed:

   Shape                     Old: BM128 BN64 stg3   NEW best
   ------------------------  ---------------------  --------------------
   D=64 N=32K M=200K K=4     6908us (1.22x)         BM64 BN64 stg3 6016us (1.40x)
   D=128 N=4K  M=1M   K=16   20488us (1.24x)        BM64 BN64 stg3 14643us (1.73x)
   D=128 N=4K  M=1M   K=4    20833us (0.98x)        BM64 BN128 stg3 11969us (1.70x)
   D=256 N=8K  M=200K K=4    -- (BM=128+D=256 OOM)  BM64 BN64 stg3 3346us (1.84x)
                             P_w fallback 5386us    -- 250.7 TFLOPS!
   D=256 N=8K  M=200K K=16   P_w fallback 9409us    BM64 BN64 stg3 4275us (1.66x)
   D=256 N=8K  M=200K K=24   P_w fallback 34276us   BM128 BN64 stg3 6866us (1.18x)

Why smaller tile wins:
  1. More CTAs => better wave fill on 132 SMs. BM=64 produces
     4x more CTAs than BM=128 at fixed N, slashing wave-tail
     latency.
  2. Less SMEM => can ALWAYS fit dist_stage=3 (deeper pipeline
     => better GEMM/TopK overlap). At D=256 BM=128 BN=128 OOMs;
     BM=64 BN=64 has plenty of headroom.
  3. Lower per-CTA register pressure => higher SM occupancy.

Why the original "big tile = good" intuition failed: that's
the right intuition for raw matmul where GEMM throughput
dominates. After Mode H eliminated the SMEM bank-conflict
wavefronts, the bottleneck shifted to wave-tail latency
(idle SMs waiting for last CTAs to finish), which smaller
tiles + more waves alleviate.

Best per-shape autotune picks (now sweeps {64,128}x{64,128}
x stage{2,3}):

   Shape                K=4         K=16        K=24         K=32
   ------------------- ----------- ----------- ------------ -----------
   D=64 N=32K M=200K   BM64 BN64   BM64 BN64   BM128 BN64   BM128 BN64
   D=128 N=16K M=100K  BM128 BN64  BM128 BN64  BM128 BN64   BM128 BN64
   D=128 N=4K  M=1M    BM64 BN128  BM64 BN64   BM64 BN64    BM64 BN64
   D=256 N=8K  M=200K  BM64 BN64   BM64 BN64   BM128 BN64   BM128 BN64

Pattern: small-K + long-M + large-D => BM=64 BN=64;
medium-batch + small-D => BM=128 BN=64. autotune picks
the right one per shape automatically.

Peak achieved TFLOPS: 250.7 (25.4% of 989 H200 BF16 peak)
at CLIP-style shape K=4. Up from 184.7 TFLOPS (18.7% peak)
before tile-size sweep -- a 36% local TFLOPS jump.

# Inline PTX cmp_swap helpers
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why inline PTX: the per-thread bitonic ``_cmp_swap_asc`` lowers
# through MLIR ``arith.cmpf + arith.select`` to PTX ``setp.gt.f32 +
# 4x selp``. ptxas refuses to fold ``(a > b) ? b : a`` into
# ``min.f32`` because of NaN semantics (min.f32 returns the non-NaN
# while the ternary preserves NaN), so we never see FMNMX in the SASS
# even though the bitonic network has thousands of these comparisons.
#
# Hand-rolling the cmp_swap as a single ``llvm.inline_asm`` block
# does two things ptxas can't reach from MLIR-lowered code:
#   1. Uses ``min.f32`` / ``max.f32`` directly for the d outputs --
#      asserting "no NaN" by construction (distances are >=0 finite
#      bf16 GEMM accumulations) so the IEEE-min vs ternary semantics
#      gap doesn't matter.
#   2. Packs all 5 PTX ops into one block so ptxas treats them as a
#      single scheduling unit, which empirically lets it co-issue the
#      i-side selps with the d-side min/max instead of serialising
#      them through one issue queue.
#
# Op count (per cmp_swap) is unchanged at 5 PTX instructions, but the
# scheduling gain is what matters: on H200 SM90a sortmerge BM=128
# BN=128 K=16, this brings the per-chunk sort+merge body from ~5.0 ms
# to ~3.X ms (matches Triton's tl.sort cost on the same shape).

          2. Cross-thread reduction across threads-in-row group to find
             the global chunk-best per row -- track ``(val, db_idx)``
             together via parallel shuffles on each, with the val
             driving the comparison.
          3. Insert global-best ``(val, db_idx)`` into the per-thread
             heap if it beats heap_max. All threads in the row group
             hold identical heaps (started from identical inits, see
             the same cooperative inserts), so the replicated update
             stays coherent.
          4. Threads whose local_min equals gval mark their local
             argmin slot as ``+inf`` so the next iter picks the
             next-best. On rare exact ties, this may mark more than one
             slot -- harmless, just slightly less work next iter.

        Once the heap fills with the true global top-K_PAD, subsequent
        iters fail the step-3 threshold and become almost free
        (no heap update, no mark).

        We deliberately do NOT early-exit the outer ``step`` loop when
        gval >= heap_max, even though it would skip work on pruned
        chunks: doing so would diverge ``shuffle_sync_bfly`` calls
        across row groups of the warp (different rows have independent
        active state, and the shuffles use mask=-1 so all 32 lanes must
        participate every call). The runtime ``if gval < hmax`` already
        gates the K_PAD-wide rescan + replace + mark work which is the
        dominant per-iter cost.

    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # The cooperative insert path above pays O(K_PAD * (N_per_thr + 3*K_PAD))
    # per row per chunk because:
    #   * the K_PAD outer iterations are constexpr-unrolled and ALWAYS
    #     execute (the runtime ``if gval < hmax`` only gates the heap touch);
    #   * each iter does K_PAD shuffles across threads-in-row.
    # The K_PAD shuffles per chunk per row is the dominant constant factor
    # and is what tanks K=10 vs Triton.
    #
    # The fast path here breaks the cooperative pattern entirely:
    #
    #   1. Each thread maintains an UNSORTED per-thread top-K over only
    #      ITS column slice of the database (N_per_thr columns per row).
    #      No cross-thread shuffles in the mainloop.
    #   2. Per chunk per row: iterate the chunk's N_per_thr elements
    #      sequentially. For each, threshold-test against per-thread
    #      heap_max[i]; on insert do a K_PAD-wide find-worst + replace.
    #   3. After the mainloop, butterfly-merge per-thread top-Ks across
    #      threads-in-row using a bitonic merge so every thread holds the
    #      global top-K, then row-leader sorts and writes.
    #
    # Why this beats the cooperative insert at K_PAD>=3:
    #   * No cross-thread shuffle in the inner loop -- the shuffle is the
    #     bottleneck (~5 cycles each, K_PAD * log T per row per chunk in
    #     the cooperative path).
    #   * Threshold prune (per-element ``if c_d < heap_max[i]``) skips the
    #     K_PAD-wide find-worst at steady state; we still pay 1 compare
    #     per element, but that's free vs the shuffle path.
    #   * Post-loop butterfly merge is a one-time cost amortised across
    #     the whole mainloop -- negligible at M >= 10K.
    #
    # Why we ALSO tried (and abandoned) bitonic chunk-sort + bitonic-merge:
    # a constexpr-unrolled bitonic sort of N_per_thr=16 in registers is ~80
    # compare-swaps per row per chunk, which alone exceeds the threshold-
    # pruned per-element insert. Triton's tl.sort is hardware-accelerated;
    # CuteDSL has no equivalent. The bitonic helpers below are kept ONLY
    # for the post-loop butterfly merge, where the input is a sorted
    # K_PAD-wide top-K (smaller, one-shot, hidden in the epilogue).
    #
    # Tie-breaking on equal distances: keep the smaller idx, matching
    # Triton's packed-uint64 sort -- gives bit-exact parity on bf16-tied
    # data after the post-loop sort.

            constant in K, vs O(K * insert_rate * N_per_thr)
            for the bubble at high K.

        State (caller-allocated, see ``kernel``):
          topk_d[i, k] : fp32 distances, SORTED asc, size K_INTERNAL
          topk_i[i, k] : int32 indices, paired with topk_d

        K_INTERNAL note: when ``K_PAD`` is non-pow2 (e.g. 24) the
        heap is rounded UP to ``K_PAD_POW2`` (e.g. 32) so the
        bitonic merge network has a pow2 length. We tried (and
        reverted) two ways to avoid this rounding:

        * ``K_INTERNAL = K_PAD`` + insertion-merge (sequential
          bubble inserts). Ops: ~K_PAD^2 with K_PAD-deep dep chain
          per insert, K_PAD inserts back-to-back -> O(K^2) critical
          path. At K=24 this measured 3-5x SLOWER than the K_INT=32
          bitonic (~25ms vs ~7.2ms at the standard benchmark shape)
          because the bitonic merge has only O(log^2 K) depth.

        * ``K_INTERNAL = K_PAD`` + virtual K_INT bitonic over a
          K_PAD-wide heap with INF padding for slots [K_PAD, K_INT).
          Reads return INF (constexpr), writes are no-ops. PROBLEM:
          the bitonic-merge-finish input ceases to be a true bitonic
          sequence because the "INF padding" must hold the chunk's
          smaller half during min-pair, which isn't simply INF. A
          correct virtual implementation needs full K_INT register
          backing for those slots -> no register saving.

        Conclusion: the K=24/32 register spill (144 bytes) is a
        structural limit of the per-thread bitonic approach. Real
        gains require either Direction 2 (decouple WGMMA tile from
        topk-chunk size, lane-cooperative bitonic via
        shuffle_sync_bfly) or Direction 3 (WS3 with topk in its own

        want the K SMALLEST distances, not largest values).

        nothing changed). Each iter compiles to ~4 selp + 1 setp PTX

        Caller MUST gate on ``c_d < topk_d[row, K-1]`` first to skip
        the whole bubble pass when ``c`` doesn't make the top-K. This
        is the single biggest win over the bitonic path: at steady

        """4-warp-group warp specialisation: load + 2 GEMM WGs + topK.

        Optimization B (WS4): doubles the WGMMA throughput by running
        TWO GEMM warpgroups on different SM sub-partitions. Each GEMM
        WG processes alternate chunks via its own
        c_pipeline / dist_pipeline. The single TopK WG consumes from
        BOTH dist pipelines in chunk order (alternating).

          WG 0 (load) : TMA loads X (once) + C; routes C to sC_a or
                        sC_b based on chunk parity.
          WG 1 (gemm_a): handles EVEN chunks (0, 2, 4, ...) using
                         c_pipeline_a / dist_pipeline_a.
          WG 2 (gemm_b): handles ODD chunks (1, 3, 5, ...) using
                         c_pipeline_b / dist_pipeline_b.
          WG 3 (topk) : consumes chunks IN ORDER alternating between
                        dist_pipeline_a (even) and dist_pipeline_b
                        (odd). Same Mode-H sWorstD logic as WS3.

        Why 2 GEMM WGs ~= 2x throughput: Hopper SM has 4 sub-partitions
        each with its own WGMMA pipe. A single warpgroup occupies one
        sub-partition's WGMMA pipe at full rate. Adding a 2nd GEMM WG
        engages a second sub-partition's pipe, doubling the issue
        bandwidth.

        Costs:
          * 2x SMEM for sC and sDist (mitigated by halving c_stage,
            keeping dist_stage=2).
          * Register pressure: load(24) + gemm_a(192) + gemm_b(192) +
            topk(96) = 504 / 512 budget per thread. Tight; may need
            tuning per tile.
          * Tile-size gate: BM*BN <= 128*128 (acc must fit 192 reg).

        Architecture (mirrors the Hopper FMHA-3 / DeepSeek-V3 attention
        WS3 pattern):

          WG 0 (load) : TMA loads X (once) and C (per chunk) into sX/sC.
          WG 1 (GEMM) : WGMMA-accumulates into a register acc, post-
                        processes into ``dist = ||x||^2 + ||c||^2 - 2*acc``,
                        and stages the BM x BN dist tile into sDist[stage]
                        in row-major. Signals dist_pipeline.producer.
          WG 2 (topK) : Waits on dist_pipeline.consumer, then runs the
                        ``smem_perthread`` bubble-insert top-K (one
                        thread per row reads BN cols from sDist[stage]).
                        Epilogue: writes the K-wide sorted heap to
                        global.

        Why this is a win over WS2 (single consumer WG doing GEMM+topK):

          * GEMM and topK previously serialised inside the consumer WG
            (~7.2ms wall at K=24 = ~4ms GEMM + ~3.5ms topK on H100 with
            the smem_perthread strategy at BM=64 BN=64). Decoupling
            them lets the GEMM WG keep WGMMA pipelines saturated while
            the topK WG runs the bubble inserts in parallel: the
            two-stage dist ring buffer (``dist_stage=2``) lets chunk
            ``c`` GEMM run concurrently with chunk ``c-1`` topK.
            Wall ≈ max(t_gemm, t_topk).

          * The topK WG holds the per-thread heap entirely in its own
            register file (240-reg bump), so the GEMM WG's WGMMA acc
            registers never have to coexist with the K_PAD-wide heap
            -- this is what removes the K_INTERNAL=32 spill from the
            sortmerge path in the WS2 kernel. (Not directly relevant
            here since WS3 mandates ``smem_perthread``, but it's the
            same architectural lever.)

        SMEM layout & sizing:

          sDist is sized BM x (BN+1) x dist_stage fp32. The +1 padding
          on BN breaks the 32-way bank conflict on the topK reads (see
          ``dist_smem_row_stride`` rationale in __init__). For
          BM=64 BN=64 dist_stage=2 that's 2 * 64 * 65 * 4 = 33 KB --
          fits comfortably alongside sX / sC in SMEM.

        Synchronization:

          x_pipeline (TMA): producer = load WG (1 thread), consumer =
            GEMM WG (4 warps, x is consumed by WGMMA only).
          c_pipeline (TMA): producer = load WG (1 thread), consumer =
            GEMM WG (4 warps, c is consumed by WGMMA only).
          dist_pipeline (PipelineAsync, mbarrier-based): producer =
            GEMM WG (128 threads), consumer = topK WG (128 threads).
            num_stages = self.dist_stage.

        Constraints (enforced in __init__):

          * topk_strategy == "smem_perthread" (the only strategy that
            doesn't depend on the WGMMA TV layout for its inputs).
          * mma_warp_groups == 1 (BM=64, or BM=128 with BN=64 -> 1
            atom). This caps total CTA size at 3*128 = 384 threads.

            # We tried 3 variants of single-WG WGMMA pipelining:
            #   A1) 2 acc tensors (acc_0/acc_1) + parity branch on
            #       c_tile_idx%2 selecting the cute.gemm target.
            #       Result: 38-164% SLOWER. The if-else around
            #       cute.gemm() doubled the static WGMMA issue
            #       path and the register allocator spilled.
            #   A2) Snapshot copy: single acc + acc_snap, pre-issue
            #       chunk N+1's WGMMA into acc, copy acc->acc_snap
            #       AFTER wait_group, process acc_snap.
            #       Result: -57 to -103% SLOWER. Same root cause:
            #       acc_snap allocation alone caused catastrophic
            #       register spill (kernel ran 100x slower).
            #   A3) Allocate acc_snap but never use it.
            #       Result: STILL 100x SLOWER. Confirms allocation
            #       alone breaks register layout.
            # CuTeDSL's `cute.make_rmem_tensor` doesn't compose well
            # for a 2nd acc-shaped tensor in the GEMM WG -- the
            # compiler can't DCE unused or alternated WGMMA targets.
            # The CUTLASS-canonical approach is WG-level pingpong
