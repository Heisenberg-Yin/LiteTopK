"""QDWH-hybrid polar / matrix-sign for symmetric A.

The default `msign` backend used by `diag.qdwh.qdwh_eig`. Two QDWH-Cholesky
iterations followed by two cubic Kenney-Laub Newton-Schulz iterations,
hybridized across precision classes:

  iter-1 Cholesky branch — fp32 SYRK (or fp64 at N≥16384), CuTe 3xbf16
    `cholesky_solve` and `potrf` at N ≤ 8192. cond(Z)≈c≈7e6 forces
    fp32-class precision on the SYRK; the 3xbf16 trsm is safe because
    Y blends into X_new at coefficient (a-b/c)·L0 ≈ 5e3·1e-5 = 0.05.
  iter-2 Cholesky branch — TF32 SYRK + BRtrtri-TF32 invert/solve.
    c≈500 makes the iterate well-conditioned, so TC paths fit in budget.
  Kenney-Laub iter-1 — bf16 inner matmuls (X^T X, M·M) + 3xbf16 output.
    The cubic next iter contracts the bf16 coefficient noise.
  Kenney-Laub iter-2 — all 3xbf16.

End-to-end residual ‖AV - Vw‖/‖A‖ ≈ 1e-3 to 5e-3, orth ‖V^T V - I‖_F ≈
1e-4. Acceptable for PCA-style use. Source of the precision ceiling for
`diag.qdwh.qdwh_eig`.

    """One QDWH iteration via Cholesky branch. Returns (X_new, L_new, c).

    `syrk_mm` optionally replaces the default fp32 X^T X. Pass `_mm_tf32`
    on iter 2 (c ~ 500) — SYRK error c * eps_tf32 = 5e-3 is well inside
    Cholesky's stability margin on Z (smallest eigenvalue ~ 1).

    `syrk_fp64=True` casts X to fp64 and does the SYRK in fp64, casting M
    back to fp32 before forming Z. This kills the O(N · eps_fp32 · ||X||²)
    SYRK accumulation error that tips Z non-PSD at large N when c ≈ 7e6
    (observed Cholesky failure at N ≥ 24576 with fp32 SYRK). Counter-
    intuitively, fp64 matmul on H100 is 10-15% *faster* than fp32 matmul
    (H100 has 67 TF/s fp64 tensor cores; fp32 lacks a tensor-core path
    in PyTorch), so this is a free correctness win. Required for
    iter-1 at N ≥ ~20k; harmless at small N.

    `invert_solve=True` computes `Y = X · Z^{-1}` via
      L_inv = solve_triangular(W, I)    # fp32 BLAS-2, one-shot
      Y = (X @ L_inv.T) @ L_inv         # two TF32 GEMMs, tensor cores
    instead of `Y = cholesky_solve(X.T, W).T` (two fp32 BLAS-2 trsms).
    At N=8192 this cuts the solve from 30.7 ms to 14.1 ms (2.2x).

    **Safe at iter 2 only.** At iter 1 X has singular values from L0≈1e-5 to
    ~1, so Y = Z^{-1}X has |Y|₂ ≈ |X|₂ (dominated by the small-SV directions
    where Z^{-1} doesn't shrink — the denominator c·σ²+1 ≈ 1 when σ ≈ L0).
    TF32 rel err in Y = 1e-5 · |X|, amplified by (a-b/c) ≈ 5e3 gives
    ~5e-2 · |X| — blows the 5e-3 residual budget (confirmed at N∈{1536,
    2048, 4096}: residual = 1.7e-2 to 3.2e-2 when iter 1 uses invert_solve).
    At iter 2 L ≈ 0.05, |Y| ≈ |X|, (a-b/c) ≈ 23, so err = 2e-4 · |X|,
    which KL contracts cubically to fp32 noise.

    `cute_chol_solve=True` replaces `torch.cholesky_solve` with the CuTe
    block-recursive inverse + two 3xbf16 GEMMs (`cholesky_solve_3xbf16`).
    Safe at iter 1 despite the c≈7e6 amplification: Y rel err ≈ 1.2e-2 but
    the (b/c)X + (a-b/c)Y blend is X-dominated (|b/c| ≈ 1, |a-b/c| ≈ 5e3·L0),
    so X_new rel err lands at ~1e-3 — inside the 5e-3 budget. Measured
